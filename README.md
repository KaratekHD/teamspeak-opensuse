# openSUSE Teamspeak build script
The Teamspeak 3 client is not avaliable in the openSUSE repositorys, as it is closed source software.
Teamspeak only provides an installer file on their website.

This script downloads the installer and builds a nice RPM file from it which you can install using `zypper`.
